# Solana Builder Program

Welcome to my Solana Cohort project repository! This project demonstrates proficiency in both TypeScript and Rust for Solana blockchain development.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main directories:

- `ts/`: Contains the TypeScript implementation
- `rs/`: Contains the Rust implementation

Each directory has its own README with specific setup and execution instructions.

## Project Overview

This project covers essential Solana development tasks, including:

1. Generating Solana keypairs
2. Requesting airdrops on the Solana devnet
3. Transferring SOL tokens
4. Interacting with custom Solana programs

Both the TypeScript and Rust implementations provide similar functionality, showcasing the ability to work with Solana using different programming languages.

## TypeScript Implementation

The TypeScript implementation is located in the `ts/` directory. It uses the `@solana/web3.js` library to interact with the Solana blockchain.

For detailed information about the TypeScript implementation, please refer to the [TypeScript README](./ts/readme.md).

## Rust Implementation

The Rust implementation is located in the `rs/` directory. It uses various Solana-related crates such as `solana-sdk`, `solana-client`, and `solana-program` for blockchain interactions.

For detailed information about the Rust implementation, please refer to the [Rust README](./rs/readme.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with either implementation:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to either the `ts/` or `rs/` directory
3. Follow the setup and execution instructions in the respective README files

## Notes

- Ensure you're connected to the Solana devnet for all operations.
- Keep your wallet files secure and do not commit them to version control.
- You may need to adjust file paths or wallet addresses based on your specific setup.

Happy coding and welcome to the world of Solana development!
